# JeNo 3" and 3.5"
_**3-3.5" drone FPV frame compatible with Air Unit O3 and designed for Freestyle, Freeride and Cinematic. Many customizable options are available.**_

![JeNo 3 - Front view](./images/JeNo3_Front.jpg)

Designed in France by members of the [WE are FPV](https://www.wearefpv.fr/) community, the JeNo is already flown by hundreds of pilots. The French version of the project is available on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/fr/model/459702-jeno-335-drone-frame). Note that a [5.1-6" version](https://github.com/WE-are-FPV/JeNo-5.1) and a [7" version](https://github.com/WE-are-FPV/JeNo-7) of the JeNo exist.

## Presentation
The success of the JeNo 5.1" has led us to develop a little brother, in 3 and 3.5". This frame will therefore be just as comfortable for Freestyle as for cinematic shooting.

On a 5" and larger, we might be tempted to keep an Action Cam, whereas on a compact and light machine, the DJI O3 reveals its full potential.

The design of a frame of this size turned out to be more delicate than expected :

Weight is crucial
Strength and rigidity remain crucial points
Electronics are more exotic: 20x20 stack with separate FC and ESCs, AiO straight or at 45°, stack mounting in M2 or M3...
The low inertia of this format makes the gyro of the O3 camera very sensitive; vibration tolerance is much lower than in 5"
Clear FOV: no spacers, frame, or visible propellers in the FPV feed
After several iterations, we have arrived at a first version of the JeNo that ticks all these boxes! This is the 3" Classic version, unibody with a 4mm bottom plate.

We were initially not enthusiastic about the unibody design, but this approach has proven to be an excellent compromise. With a thickness of 4mm at the bottom plate level, we obtain exceptional strength and flight behavior worthy of a 5". The assembly remains easy, and the absence of separate arms allows for sliding a 20x20 stack while taking advantage of the 20mm height of the bus.








Finally, as this frame was designed by members of the [WE are FPV](https://www.wearefpv.fr/) community, a "WaF edition" is available (the logo is engraved on the bottom plate). Join us on the WAF forum in [the official JeNo 3-3.5" thread](https://forum.wearefpv.fr/topic/20437-jeno-335-un-ch%C3%A2ssis-compact-taill%C3%A9-pour-le-dji-o3/) to discuss it further.

## Customization

The JeNo is customizable, offering several **options** to best adapt to different needs and individual preferences.

## Buy it or cut it !

You can get it cut in your favourite flavour and source the materials yourself. Like the 5.1" version, the JeNo 3" should be available from Drone FPV Racer in a near future.

## Bill of materials

In addition to the carbon fiber, you will need the following hardware to complete the assembly of the frame.

## Changelog

`Compatibility is consistently maintained between each version: if your frame was a v1, the parts from v1.2 will be compatible. The same applies to TPU accessories. That's why we don't keep the history of previous versions.`
